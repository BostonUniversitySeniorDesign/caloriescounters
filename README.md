Decision Stages
1 - Discussed overall Design of app and the features that we will include. Also talked about using the React-Native framework & Google Firebase for storage options.
2 - After building the initial UI using React Native, the integration of  Google OAuth into the app was deprecated for React. After further communicated, we mutually decided to switch to Flutter in order to keep all aspects of the app consistent to Google based frameworks. 
https://blog.codemagic.io/firebase-authentication-google-sign-in-using-flutter/ -(Primarily utilized document on how to implement the google authentication and set up the firebase- required Hin Luis help to generate the SHA Key for android system).
3- Place holder sign in page with google oauth was built, which was succeeded by the development of the features within the home page of the app.
(Barcode scanner was built using https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_barcode_scanner which is the official repositary for Flutter packages)
